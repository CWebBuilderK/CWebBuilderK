![PHP Developer](https://img.shields.io/badge/PHP-Developer-orange#php)

Hello I'm CWebBuilderK,

I am interested in programming. I am currently learning a lot of web development things. I'm would like to collaborate on projects immersed in the development profession. I want to develop projects from brief to deployment/maintenance. I also want to develop the physical network for those projects. I can be reached at wb@califkidd.com. 

GitHub is cool!

Trying to be a better developer:
Never ask for advice you don't intend to use.
Never ask for advice and not use that advice.
Never get mad because someone gave you advice.
